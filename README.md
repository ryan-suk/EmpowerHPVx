# EmpowerHPVx (Adult HPV vaccination decision-making)

## Project Overview

**EmpowerHPVx** is a research initiative aiming to improve informed decision-making for HPV vaccination among adults aged 27–45. Despite national guidelines supporting *shared clinical decision-making (SDM)* in this age group, optimal benefit is limited—often due to confusion, stigma, and inaccessible or overly technical information.

This project addresses these challenges by:
- **Analyzing public discourse** around HPV vaccination using natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs)
- **Identifying key emotional and informational gaps** in how adults understand and engage with HPV vaccine-related decisions

## Methodological Highlights

- Integrating LLM-powered NLP
- Use of social media and chatbot-generated content to assess communication quality

## Repository Contents

- `data/`: Placeholder or linked directory for de-identified data (if publicly shareable)
- `code/`: Scripts used for text preprocessing, topic modeling, and qualitative clustering
- `docs/`: Project summary documents, plain-language explanations, and IRB-approved protocols (as shareable)
- `README.md`: This file

## Intended Impact

This work aims to advance equitable, evidence-based decision-making about adult HPV vaccination by addressing key gaps in communication and accessibility—particularly for communities affected by social stigma, low health literacy, or limited engagement with traditional care systems.
